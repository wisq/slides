# Slides for my talks

Here's where you can find whatever I put up on screen for my live presentations, whether it's actual slides, Markdown documents, example scripts, etc.

There's not much context here â€” I'm assuming you attended the talk and are now referencing or reviewing the things I covered, or you just need a jumping-off point to do your own research.  But if anything is particularly unclear and you think it could be improved, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/wisq/slides/issues) or submit a pull request.
